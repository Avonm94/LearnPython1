# What is Python:
# Python is a dynamically typed, General Purpose Programming Language that,
# supports an object-oriented programming approach as well as a functional programming approach.
# Python is also an interpreted and high-level programming language.
# It was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1989.

# Features of Python:
# Python is simple and easy to understand.
# It is Interpreted and platform-independent which makes debugging very easy.
# Python is an open-source programming language.
# Python provides huge library support.
# Some of the popular libraries include NumPy, Tensorflow, Selenium, OpenCV, etc.
# It is possible to integrate other programming languages within python.

# What is Python used for:
# Python is used in Data Visualization to create plots and graphical representations.
# Python helps in Data Analytics to analyze and understand raw data for insights and trends.
# It is used in AI and Machine Learning to simulate human behavior and to learn from past data without hard coding.
# It is used to create web applications.
# It can be used to handle databases.
# It is used in business and accounting to perform complex mathematical operations,
# along with quantitative and qualitative analysis.

# Python is Case Sensitive Programming Lang.
# Python is Dynamically Typed Lang
# No need to declare anything. An assignment statement binds a name to an object, and the object can be of any type.
# No type casting is required when using container objects.
