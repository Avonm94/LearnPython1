# Python Object-Oriented Programming Into.
###########################################################################################
# Python is also an object-oriented language since its beginning.
# It allows us to develop applications using an Object-Oriented approach.
# In Python, we can easily create and use classes and objects.

# An object-oriented paradigm is to design the program using classes and objects. The object is related to real-word
# entities such as book, house, pencil, etc. The 5.oops concept focuses on writing the reusable code. It is a
# widespread technique to solve the problem by creating objects.

# Major principles of an object-oriented programming system are given below.
# Class, Object, Method
# Inheritance
# Polymorphism
# Data Abstraction
# Encapsulation

# Class
# A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class.
# The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation.

# Object An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example,
# is an instance of the class Circle. A unique instance of a data structure that is defined by its class. An object
# comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods.

# Encapsulation
# Data members of class are available for processing to functions defined within the class only.
# Functions of class on the other hand are accessible from outside class context.
# So object data is hidden from environment that is external to class.
# Class function (also called method) encapsulates object data so that unwarranted access to it is prevented.


# Inheritance
# A software modeling approach of OOP enables extending capability of an existing class to build new class
# instead of building from scratch.
# In OOP terminology, existing class is called base or parent class, while new class is called child or sub class.
# Child class inherits data definitions and methods from parent class.
# This facilitates reuse of features already available.
# Child class can add few more definitions or redefine a base class function.

# Polymorphism
# It is a Greek word meaning having multiple forms.
# In OOP, polymorphism occurs when each sub class provides
# its own implementation of an abstract method in base class.
