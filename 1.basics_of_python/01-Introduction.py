# Introduction to Python
###########################################################################################

# What is Python:
# Python is a dynamically typed, General Purpose Programming Language that,
# supports an object-oriented programming approach as well as a functional programming approach.
# Python is also an interpreted and high-level programming language.
# It was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1989.

# Features of Python:
# Python is simple and easy to understand.
# It is Interpreted and platform-independent which makes debugging very easy.
# Python is an open-source programming language.
# Python provides huge library support.
# Some of the popular libraries include NumPy, Tensorflow, Selenium, OpenCV, etc.
# It is possible to integrate other programming languages within python.

# What is Python used for:
# Python is used in Data Visualization to create plots and graphical representations.
# Python helps in Data Analytics to analyze and understand raw data for insights and trends.
# It is used in AI and Machine Learning to simulate human behavior and to learn from past data without hard coding.
# It is used to create web applications.
# It can be used to handle databases.
# It is used in business and accounting to perform complex mathematical operations,
# along with quantitative and qualitative analysis.

# Python is Case Sensitive Programming Lang.
# Python is Dynamically Typed Lang
# No need to declare anything. An assignment statement binds a name to an object, and the object can be of any type.
# No type casting is required when using container objects.

# Python Popular Frameworks and Libraries
# Python has wide range of libraries and frameworks widely used in various fields such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, web applications, etc. We define some popular frameworks and libraries of Python as follows.
#
# Web development (Server-side) - Django Flask, Pyramid, CherryPy
# GUIs based applications - Tk, PyGTK, PyQt, PyJs, etc.
# Machine Learning - TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Scipy, etc.
# Mathematics - Numpy, Pandas, etc.
# BeautifulSoup: a library for web scraping and parsing HTML and XML
# Requests: a library for making HTTP requests
# SQLAlchemy: a library for working with SQL databases
# Kivy: a framework for building multi-touch applications
# Pygame: a library for game development
# Pytest: a testing framework for Python
# Django REST framework: a toolkit for building RESTful APIs
# FastAPI: a modern, fast web framework for building APIs
# Streamlit: a library for building interactive web apps for machine learning and data science
# NLTK: a library for natural language processing

# Python Naming Conventions
# 1. General
#     Avoid using names that are too general or too wordy. Strike a good balance between the two.
#     Bad: data_structure, my_list, info_map, dictionary_for_the_purpose_of_storing_data_representing_word_definitions
#     Good: user_profile, menu_options, word_definitions
#     Don’t be a jackass and name things “O”, “l”, or “I”
#     When using CamelCase names, capitalize all letters of an abbreviation (e.g. HTTPServer)

# 2. Packages
#     Package names should be all lower case
#     When multiple words are needed, an underscore should separate them
#     It is usually preferable to stick to 1 word names

# 3. Modules
#     Module names should be all lower case
#     When multiple words are needed, an underscore should separate them
#     It is usually preferable to stick to 1 word names

# 4. Classes
#     Class names should follow the UpperCaseCamelCase convention
#     Python’s built-in classes, however are typically lowercase words
#     Exception classes should end in “Error”

# 5. Global (module-level) Variables
#     Global variables should be all lowercase
#     Words in a global variable name should be separated by an underscore

# 6. Instance Variables
#     Instance variable names should be all lower case
#     Words in an instance variable name should be separated by an underscore
#     Non-public instance variables should begin with a single underscore
#     If an instance name needs to be mangled, two underscores may begin its name

# 7. Methods
#     Method names should be all lower case
#     Words in an method name should be separated by an underscore
#     Non-public method should begin with a single underscore
#     If a method name needs to be mangled, two underscores may begin its name

# 8. Method Arguments
#     Instance methods should have their first argument named ‘self’.
#     Class methods should have their first argument named ‘cls’

# 9. Functions
#     Function names should be all lower case
#     Words in a function name should be separated by an underscore

# 10. Constants
#     Constant names must be fully capitalized
#     Words in a constant name should be separated by an underscore
